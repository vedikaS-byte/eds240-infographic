# Anatomy of a Spotify Hit: What Defines Popular Music on Spotify

```{r}
high_popular <- read.csv(here::here("data", "high_popularity_spotify_data.csv"))

low_popular <- read.csv(here::here("data", "low_popularity_spotify_data.csv"))

```

## Questions considered in the analysis:

-   Are hit songs happier (based on valence)?
-   Do popular songs cluster around certain energy-danceability combinations? (Energy vs Danceability), alpha for density
-   Which genres dominate Spotify hits? (how does genre composition differ among popular tracks?)... use playlist_genre... genre distribution
-   Who dominates Spotify’s most popular songs? (who dominates Spotify’s most popular songs)
