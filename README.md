# Anatomy of a Spotify Hit: What Defines Popular Music on Spotify

## Description

This repository contains the data and R code used to create an infographic composed of multiple visualizations that will illustrate different aspects of Spotify hits. The visual analysis draws on publicly available data from the [*Spotify Music Dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solomonameh/spotify-music-dataset) by Solomon Ameh, accessed via Kaggle.

Questions currently brainstormed for the analysis include:

-   Are hit songs happier (based on valence)?

-   Do popular songs cluster around certain energy-danceability combinations?

-   Which genres dominate Spotify hits? Essentially, how does genre composition differ between popular and less popular tracks?

-   Who dominates Spotify’s most popular songs?

    -   Who dominates Spotify’s most popular songs compared to less popular tracks?
